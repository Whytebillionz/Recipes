        Discription
    </h2>

    <p>
        Onunu is a tasty mouthwatering delicacy from Rivers
        State in the south-south part of Nigeria. It is the 
        traditional meal of the Ijaw, Kalabari, Degema
        and Opobo people of Rivers State and Awara/ASA in 
        Imo state.

            Onunu is mashed yam and plantain mixed with palm
            oil and some salt. it is prepared as a smooth mash 
            (not heavy or glutinous dough like pounded yam).
            the major type of plantain uesd is over-riped 
            plantain.

            Rinse the plantain whole and divide into
            three or four (unpeeled) and cook concurrently
            with the yam.

        <li>
            Place yam in a mortal(large enough) and
