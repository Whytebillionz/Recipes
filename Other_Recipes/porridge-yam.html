    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Asaro which is also known as Yam pottage or
        Yam porridge is a very delicious Yam recipe
        though it's eaten by most tribes in Nigeria
        however, it is more common in the 
        Yoruba-speaking parts of Nigeria. 
        It's also easy to make.
        If you love yam, it's a must-try recipe!

            Fresh palm oil
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Onions
        </li><br>

        <li>Salt to taste</li><br>

        <li>
            Bouillon powder
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Fish and crayfish
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Vegetable (optional)
        </li><br>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol type="i">

        <li>
            Peel and cut and rinse the yam. Ensure that 
            you rinse the yam more than once until the 
            water is clear and no longer cloudy. The 
            yam should be in medium-sized chunks
            about 2 inches thick.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Blend your pepper mix. Blend the 
            bell pepper, habanero, tomato, and half
            onion.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Cook the yam and the pepper mix together. Put
            the first yams inside a pot, and add the pepper
            mix, salt, bouillon powder, and water.
            Cover and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium 
            to high heat.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Stir in the Palm oil, sliced onions, and 
            crayfish. Cover again and let it cook extra
            10 minutes.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Mash the yams. You can use a potato masher or
            a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams
            and keep some chunks. It gives more texture!
        </li><br>

        <li>
           Add the fish. You can smoke fish, dried,
            boiled, canned, or stockfish. You can also add 
           smoked turkey or any other meat you prefer.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Stir in the herbs or any other leafy
            vegetable of your choice.
            Serve and enjoy while still hot!
        </li><br>
