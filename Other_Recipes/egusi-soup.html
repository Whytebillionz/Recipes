        Discription

    <p>
        Egusi Soup is a soup made with a 
        white kind of pumpkin seeds Ground egusi 
        (or pumpkin seeds) is the main ingredient. 
        Other ingredients include red palm oil, African 
        crayfish, meats and fish, seasoning,
        hot pepper and some form of leafy greens.
        Egusi soup is nutty, spicy and so rich thanks
        to the variety of meats and fish often used.

        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol type="1">

        <li>
            Boil the meats and/or fish you intend to use.
            Preferably do this the day before so making
             your egusi soup is easy the next day.
        </li><br>

        
        <li>
          Grind the egusi. I advise that you always buy whole 
         egusi seeds and grind them yourself. That way you are
         sure of the quality of the seeds. 
         Pre-ground egusi is not always the best.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Saute onions in red palm oil, cook egusi in red
             palm oil then add the boiled meats, crayfish and 
            seasoning.
        </li><br>

    </ol>
